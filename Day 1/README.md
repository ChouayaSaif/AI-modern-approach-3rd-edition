# Eight Puzzle Game

This is a simple graphical implementation of the **Eight Puzzle** using Python's `tkinter`. The game allows users to scramble the puzzle, manually solve it by swapping tiles, or use the **A* search algorithm** to find the optimal solution.

## Features
- Graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter`.
- Scramble the puzzle randomly.
- Manually swap tiles to solve the puzzle.
- Automatically solve the puzzle using the **A* search algorithm**.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

## Installation
```sh
# Clone the repository (if applicable)
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>

# Install dependencies (if needed)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game
```sh
python eight_puzzle.py
```

## How to Play
1. Click **Scramble** to shuffle the puzzle.
2. Click on a tile adjacent to the empty space to move it.
3. Click **Solve** to let the algorithm find the solution.

## Planned Improvements
- Refactor the code into an object-oriented structure.
- Optimize the graphical interface.
- Enhance the puzzle-solving logic.
